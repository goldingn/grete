#' @name mixture
#' @title mixtures of probability distributions
#'
#' @description \code{mixture} combines other probability distributions into a
#'   single mixture distribution, either over a variable, or for fixed data.
#'
#' @param ... variable greta arrays following probability distributions (see
#'   \code{\link{distributions}}); the component distributions in a mixture
#'   distribution.
#'
#' @param weights a column vector or array of mixture weights, which must be
#'   positive, but need not sum to one. The first dimension must be the number
#'   of distributions, the remaining dimensions must either be 1 or match the
#'   distribution dimension.
#'
#' @param dim the dimensions of the greta array to be returned, either a scalar
#'   or a vector of positive integers.
#'
#' @details The \code{weights} are rescaled to sum to one along the first
#'   dimension, and are then used as the mixing weights of the distribution.
#'   I.e. the probability density is calculated as a weighted sum of the
#'   component probability distributions passed in via \code{\dots}
#'
#'   The component probability distributions must all be either continuous or
#'   discrete, and must have the same dimensions.

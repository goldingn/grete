greta relies on, and was inspired by some pretty incredible pieces of software which deserve recognition.

### Google Tensorflow

greta wouldn't be possible without [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), Googles computation engine for large-scale machine learning. Tensorflow runs all of greta's calculations, enables distributed computations on multi-core and GPU systems, and carries out automatic differentiation efficiently, enabling greta to use efficient inference algorithms like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

### R packages

Tensorflow is implemented in C++ and Python. [Rstudio's](https://www.rstudio.com/) [reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) and [tensorflow](https://rstudio.github.io/tensorflow/) packages provide the magic that bring TensorFlow and all things python to R.
Under the hood, greta also uses Winston Chang's [R6](https://github.com/wch/R6) object system, and greta's model plotting functionality is made possible by [DiagrammeR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/).

### MCMC software

The design and scope of greta was inspired by other general-purpose MCMC software like [BUGS](http://www.openbugs.net/) and [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) that have enabled researchers to focus on modelling, rather than writing code. [Stan's](http://mc-stan.org/) approach of using automatic differentiation to enable efficient MCMC was a particularly big influence on greta, and the quality and quantity of Stan's documentation and examples are something greta aspires to.

### python packages

The python package [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/) also uses TensorFlow as a backend for general-purpose statistical modelling, in a very elegant and pythonic way. [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) uses a similar approach for the more specialised area of Gaussian process modelling,  and was a strong influence on how greta is implemented.

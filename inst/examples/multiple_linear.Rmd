### Multiple linear regression

A multi-variable Bayesian linear regression model using the attitude data

```{r multiple_linear_greta}
# the predictors as a matrix
design <- as.matrix(attitude[, 2:7])

int <- normal(0, 10)
coefs <- normal(0, 10, dim = ncol(design))
sd <- cauchy(0, 3, truncation = c(0, Inf))

# matrix multiplication is more efficient than multiplying the coefficients
# separately
mu <- int + design %*% coefs

distribution(attitude$rating) <- normal(mu, sd)
```

### Multiple species modelling independently and concurrently

An example of a logistic regression being used to estimate the probability of multiple species' presences along a number of environmental gradients. Although modelled concurrently, the random variables for each species are independent. We first simulate some data to model followed by the `greta` code.

Where a single observation per species and location would have a bernoulli error distribution, multiple observations for each species and location have a binomial distribution. The small change in the code is commented below.

When modelling multiple species (or other grouping factor), we need an extra step in constructing the linear predictor. In order to add multiple `greta` arrays together *for each species* we can use the `sweep()` function.

#### data
```{r data_multispecies_bernoulli, highlight = FALSE}
# make fake data
n_species <- 5
n_env <- 3
n_sites <- 20

env <- matrix(rnorm(n_sites * n_env), nrow = n_sites)
occupancy <- matrix(rbinom(n_species * n_sites, 1, 0.5), nrow = n_sites)
```

#### greta code
```{r multispecies_bernoulli_greta}
# load greta
library(greta)

# create matrices to greta arrays
X <- as_data(env)
Y <- as_data(occupancy)

# variables
alpha <- normal(0,10, dim = n_species)
beta <- normal(0, 10, dim = c(n_env, n_species))

env_effect <- X %*% beta

# matrix addition with `sweep()` create interim variable
linear_predictor <- sweep(env_effect, 2, alpha, FUN = '+')

# ilogit of linear predictor
p <- ilogit(linear_predictor)

# a single observation means our data are bernoulli distributed
distribution(Y) <- bernoulli(p)
# for n_obs repeat observations per species/location, we could use the binomial
# distribution:
# distribution(Y) <- binomial(n_obs, p) 
```

#' @name mixture
#' @title mixtures of probability distributions
#'
#' @description \code{mixture} combines other probability distributions into a
#'   single mixture distribution, either over a variable, or for fixed data.
#'
#' @param ... variable greta arrays following probability distributions (see
#'   \code{\link{distributions}}); the component distributions in a mixture
#'   distribution.
#'
#' @param weights a column vector greta array with as many elements as
#'   probability distributions. The elements must be positive, but need not sum
#'   to one.
#'
#' @param dim the dimensions of the greta array to be returned, either a scalar
#'   or a vector of positive integers.
#'
#' @details The \code{weights} are rescaled to sum to one, and are then used as
#'   the mixing weights of the distribution. \emph{Ie.} the probability density
#'   is calculated as a weighted sum of the component probability distributions
#'   passed in via \code{\dots}
#'
#'   The component probability distributions must all be either continuous or
#'   discrete, and must have the same dimensions.

# About *greta*

### What is greta?
*greta* is a [probabilistic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming_language)
embedded in [R](https://www.r-project.org).
It lets you define a probability model for your data, 
meaning you give the *form* of your data's distribution
(e.g., normal, gamma, etc),
and you give the *distributions* of its
[hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter).
Given the data and your model, *greta* uses
[Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo)
to characterize those distributions.

This documentation includes [several examples](/greta/articles/example_models.html)
of using *greta*.

### What makes it cool?
First, *greta* is embedded directly in R,
working side by side with your other tools for data, statistics, graphics,
and programming.
This is more convenient and more powerful than similar systems
where the software exists outside R.

Second, *greta* uses [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
a powerful framework for mathematical computation.
TensorFlow can run either locally or in the cloud,
giving you access to tremendous computer power.
That is a significant advantage in computationally intensive applications
such as MCMC.

### How can I install *greta*?

At a minimum, you'll need two components

- Tensorflow
- *greta* package

Most users, however, will also want the *DiagrammeR* package
in order to plot and check their probability models.
I strongly recommend installing it.

*Tensorflow* - Before you can fit models with *greta*, you will also need to have a working installation of Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Python package (version 1.0.0 or higher). *greta* exports `install_tensorflow()` from the `tensorflow` R package, which will attempt to install the latest version of TensorFlow from within your R session.

```
install_tensorflow()
```

You can use this function to install different versions of TensorFlow, including versions with GPU acceleration. If you're having trouble with this step, [this guide](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation.html) may help.

*greta package* - You can install the stable version of greta from CRAN:

```
install.packages("greta")
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest release, or the development version, from GitHub using the devtools package:

```
devtools::install_github("greta-dev/greta")  # latest release
devtools::install_github("greta-dev/greta@dev")  # development version
```

*DiagrammeR package* - The *greta* [plotting functionality](#plotting) depends on the [DiagrammeR package](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/). Because Diagrammer automatically installs a lot of other packages it can take a long time to install, so DiagrammeR isn't installed automatically with greta. If you want to plot models, you can install DiagrammeR from CRAN.

```
install.packages('DiagrammeR')
```

### How does *greta* compare to . . . 
*Stan* and *rstan*

*Edward*

*JAGS*

*BUGS and WinBUGS*

### Why is it called "greta"?
There's a recent convention of naming statistical modelling software after pioneers in the field (e.g. [Stan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam) and [Edward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)).

<img style="float: right;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/Grete_Hermann.jpg">

[Grete Hermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grete_Hermann) wasn't a statistician. She wrote [the first algorithms](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=307342&coll=portal&dl=ACM) for computer algebra; in the 1920s, well before the first electronic computer was built. This work laid the foundations for the computer algebra libraries that enable modern statistical modelling.

In case that's not enough reason to admire her, Grete Hermann also [disproved a popular theorem in quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3986.pdf) and was part of the German resistance against the Nazi regime prior to World War Two.

Grete (usually said *Greh*â€¢tuh, like its alternate spelling *Greta*) can be confusing for non-German speakers to pronounce, so I've taken the liberty of naming the package *greta* instead. You can call it whatever you like.

# Bayesian computation

### How do I prepare my data for *greta*?
*TBA*

### Can *greta* estimate the MAP (maximum a posteriori) probability of a model?
Yes. Define your data and model,
and then use the [opt](/greta/reference/inference.html) function.

### Can *greta* perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)?
Yes. Define your data and model,
then use the [mcmc](/reference/inference.html) function.

### Can I use multiple cores to run multiple chains in parallel? If so, how?
*TBD*

### Can I use a Tensorflow cluster to run multiple chains in parallel? If so, how?
*TBD*

### What tools are available for evaluating the MCMC results?
*TBD*

### Can *greta* perform variational Bayesian inference (a.k.a. variational inference)?
[Variational inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods)
is not yet implemented.
